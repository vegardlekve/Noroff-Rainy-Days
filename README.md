This was our first project at my front end design studies. We continued to build on it through the year, in different courses. 

## Description

The task was to build a web page with a online shop that sells rain jackets for men and women. This was a cross-course in design, html and css, 
interaction design and cms.
Other requirements was that the site should be responsive, quick to download and consider WCAG and SEO.

The site architecture should consist off:
- Home
- List of Jackets
- A jacket specific page showing the jacket
- A checkout page
- A checkout success
- About
- Contact

Later we were tasked with adding better functionality with interaction design, and content through Wordpress' REST API. 

I'm not particularly pleased with the result, but considering my first lines of code were written in this project, it stands to show how much I've learned
the past year.
